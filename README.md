This project focuses on automatically detecting and reading vehicle registration number plates using deep learning. The system identifies the number plate from an image using the YOLO object detection model, crops the detected plate, and extracts the text using OCR. It is designed to work on Indian vehicle number plates, which vary widely in style, size, and font.

The main purpose of this project is to automate the number plate recognition process for applications such as:

Traffic monitoring

Parking management

Toll booths

Security & surveillance systems

Automated entry/exit systems
