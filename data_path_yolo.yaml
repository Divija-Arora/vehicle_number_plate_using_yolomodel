# This file is used to define the paths for training and validation datasets
# 'nc' is the number of classes, and 'names' is a list of class names.
# Make sure to adjust the paths according to your dataset structure.
# Example:
# train: "/path/to/train"
# val: "/path/to/val"
# nc: 1  # Number of classes
# names: ['class_name']  # List of class names
# Ensure that the paths are absolute or relative to the current working directory.
# The paths should point to the directories containing the training and validation images.
# The 'train' directory should contain images for training, and the 'val' directory should
# contain images for validation. The images should be in a format supported by YOLO (e.g., .jpg, .png).
